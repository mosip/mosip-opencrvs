# MOSIP OpenCRVS Integration - MOSIP Side Mediator

## Overview
This repo contains following MOSIP side of components for the MOSIP OpenCRVS integration:
  - _MOSIP side OpenCRVS Mediator_ ([`mosip-side-opencrvs-mediator`](./mediator)) receives data from OpenCRVS, creates registration packet, and uploads it to registration processor.
  - _OpenCRVS Registration Processor Stage_ ([`registration-processor-opencrvs-stage`](./registration-processor-opencrvs-stage)) is added as the last stage in MOSIP registration-processor pipeline, to issue the credentials back to OpenCRVS, after registration is successful.

This repo is not to be confused with [OpenCRVS side MOSIP Mediator](https://github.com/opencrvs/mosip-mediator/tree/master), which is also part of MOSIP OpenCRVS integration, that receives the credential(UIN) issued by MOSIP, and processes it as required.

_This is work-in-progress_.
